# Scaling Up Systems

## Strong Scaling

1. Definition
   1. Increase the number of workers (GPUs)
   2. Keep the size of the minibatch per worker constant

## Weak Scaling

1. Definition
   1. Increase the number of workers (GPUs)
   2. Increase the size of the minibatch per worker

## Performance

1. Workload increases with batch sizes (More epochs are needed to reach the same accuracy with larger batch sizes)
