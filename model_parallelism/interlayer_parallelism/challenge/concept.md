# Challenges

1. Computation-Communication Overlap
   1. It's hard to overlap computation and communication stages.
2. Scaling Efficiency
   1. Although k-subminibatches help with scaling efficiency, it's hard to achieve linear scaling.
3. Load Imbalance
   1. Different servers assigned to different layers of the model may have different processing time.
